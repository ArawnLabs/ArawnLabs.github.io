    <h1>Runner Whale Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Runner Whale game processes and protects user data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Runner Whale game does not directly collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, address, etc.) from its users. However, some indirect or anonymous data may be collected to provide the game experience, improve performance, and analyze usage. This data may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information such as your device model, operating system version, and language settings may be used to ensure the game functions properly and for debugging purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Progress and Scores:</strong> Data like your in-game progress and scores may be stored locally on your device or synchronized via third-party services like Google Play Games Services. This is for features such as leaderboards and achievements.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> General statistics about how the game is used (e.g., how long the game is played, which sections are frequently used) may be collected in an anonymized and aggregated form. This data is used to improve game performance and inform future updates. This data does not directly identify a user.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> In the event of a game crash, technical details such as device information and the cause of the crash may be automatically collected to improve game stability. These reports are generally anonymous and do not contain personal information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If our game uses advertising services, ad providers (e.g., Google AdMob) may collect anonymized or pseudonymized data such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID) to personalize ads and measure their performance. Such data does not directly reveal your personal identity.</p>
    <p>The data we collect is used to provide game functionality, enhance the game experience, fix bugs, and fulfill legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Runner Whale may integrate with third-party services for the purposes mentioned above, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Games Services:</strong> For leaderboards and achievements.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics / Firebase Analytics:</strong> For app usage analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Providers (e.g., Google AdMob):</strong> For in-game ad display and analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and the data they collect is subject to those policies. It is recommended to review the privacy policies of the relevant third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of user data is important to us. We take appropriate security measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. Data may be retained for longer periods to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our game is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children under 13, we will promptly delete such information from our systems.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any significant changes to the policy will be posted on this page or communicated appropriately within the application. It is recommended to review the policy periodically.</p>
